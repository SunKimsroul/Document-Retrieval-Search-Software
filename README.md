# Document-Retrieval-Search-Software
Project Title:
Document Retrieval Search Software

Project Issue/Problem to be Solved:
Developing a Python program to enable users to search for Word, Excel, PDF, Text, and Python files within a specified directory using keywords.

Current Progress (PDLC):
Problem Analysis: Identified the need for a document retrieval program.
Design: Designed the structure of the program and its functionalities.
Implementation: Implemented the core functionalities and graphical user interface using PySide2.
Testing: Conducted initial testing to ensure the program's functionality.

Project Functions/Features:
Input directory selection.
Filename input for searching.
Keyword input for further search refinement.
Searching for files matching the filename within the directory and its subdirectories.
Displaying search results, including filenames and paths.
Support for searching within Word, Excel, PDF, Text, and Python files.
GUI implemented using PySide2.

Expected Number of Pages:
Home Page (Sign up/Login): 1 page
Search Interface: 1 page
Requirements Analysis: 1 page
Outline Design: 1 page
Detailed Design and Implementation: 1 page
Testing and Presentation: 1 page

Database Applied:
The program does not use a database. It interacts directly with the file system.

Project Reference/Source:
This project does not have any references due to it being my own imagination and my own struggle with finding documents in the file directory.
